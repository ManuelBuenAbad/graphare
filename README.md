==============================================

Authors: Manuel A. Buen-Abad, Jae Hyeok Chang, Anson Hook

GraPhaRe
-----------------------------------

This code has been written in Wolfram language using Mathematica 12.0 by Manuel A. Buen-Abad and Jae Hyeok Chang (2022).



Installing the code
--------------

There are two packages: `DSReheating.wl`, which computes the reheating history of the dark sector; and `PhaseTransition.wl`, which computes various observables from the first-order phase transition.

To install, simply open a Mathematica notebook and:

1. Go to File -> Install.
2. In the "Source" drop menu, click "From File...".
3. Select the package.
4. Click "OK".


To call the packages, simply enter the following commands in a Mathematica cell:

    Needs["DSReheating`"]
    Needs["PhaseTransition`"]
